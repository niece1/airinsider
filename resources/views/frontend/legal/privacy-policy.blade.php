        <h2>California privacy rights</h2>
        <p>
            If you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.
        </p>

            California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from
            us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed
            to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we
            shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year.
        </p>
        <p>
            The California Code of Regulations defines a "resident" as:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                every individual who is in the State of California for other than a temporary or transitory purpose and
            </li>
            <li>
                every individual who is domiciled in the State of California who is outside the State of California for a
                temporary or transitory purpose
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>All other individuals are defined as "non-residents".</p>
        <p>
            If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit a verifiable consumer
            request in writing to us using the <a href="{{ route('contact') }}">contact information.</a>. Only you as the

            your personal information or someone you authorize to act on your behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to verify that you are the
            person you are claiming to be or that you are the authorized representative of such person about whom we had
            collected personal information. You must describe your request with enough details such as your first and last
            name, your address and country that allow us to properly understand the request and respond to it. Please note
            we cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information unless we first verify your identity
            or authority to make such a request and confirm that the personal information relates to you. We will make all
            attempts to respond to your request within 30 days of receipt.
