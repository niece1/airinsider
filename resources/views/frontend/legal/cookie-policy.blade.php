        <h2>What is a cookie?</h2>
        <p>
            Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored on your computer or other device when
            websites are loaded in a browser. They are used to "remember" you and your preferences, either for a single
            visit or for multiple repeat visits. Websites and emails may also contain other tracking technologies such as
            "web beacons" or "pixels." These are typically small transparent images that provide us with statistics, for
            similar purposes as cookies. They are often used in conjunction with cookies, though they are not stored on
            your computer in the same way as cookies. As a result, if you disable cookies, web beacons may still load, but
            their functionality will be restricted.
        </p>
        <h2>How do we use cookies?</h2>
        <p>
            We use cookies for several different purposes. Some cookies are necessary for technical reasons, some enable
            a personalized experience for both registered and unregistered users. And some allow the display of advertising
            from selected third party networks. Some of these cookies may be set when a page is loaded, or when a user
            takes a particular action on on the website. Many of the cookies we use are only set if you are a registered
            user, while others are set whenever you visit our website (irrespective of whether you have an account).
        </p>
        <h2>What types of cookies do we use?</h2>

                applications and services to enhance the experience of website visitors. These include social media
                platforms such as Facebook and Twitter (through the use of sharing buttons). As a result, cookies may be
                set by these third parties, and used by them to track your online activity. We have no direct control over
                the information that is collected by these cookies.
